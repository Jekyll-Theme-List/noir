Noir is developed using and hosted with GitHub. You can head on over to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) to download it, report any bugs, and to request features.

If you prefer to install the gem version of the theme you can do so [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/noir-for-jekyll).

Here are all of the changes in this latest release:

#### CHANGELOG

<span class="improved">IMPROVED</span> Ordinal, rather than cardinal display of dates is now the default.

<span class="improved">IMPROVED</span> Home and per-post pagination are now styled and function identically.

<span class="added">ADDED</span> Replace assets/imessage.png with the image of your choice and 
whenever a link to your website is shared using iMessage for iOS/macOS/watchOS it will be
shared as a rich link with the image you chose rather than just displaying the favicon.
This feature can also be extended to show a specific image per post/page instead.
